It can be a troubling time but we do have hope on the horizon, with the news we get daily about vaccines. Multiple companies releasing and getting their vaccines approved; we may yet soon see a path forward. 

The CDC in the US releases daily vaccine data and has a vaccination progress tracker on its site [CDC Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations).

NBC News has a vaccine tracker as well which is quite well done.

Using the robust toolset provided by Kaggle I decided to create my own data tracker

The dataset for vaccine data is drawn from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) who update their vaccine datasets from the CDC quite regularly, this allows the notebook to have fresh data.

Here is the link to that [dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv)

THe population dataset is pulled from the 2019 US Census and I've uploaded it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/peretzcohen/2019-census-us-population-data-by-state) along with latitude and longitude data for each states' capital city. 

Feel Free to fork this notebook and improve on my work, I look forward to seeing what you create!
