Covid 19 Vaccine Tracker by State - Notebook is live on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/peretzcohen/us-vaccine-status-by-state/data

It can be a troubling time but we do have hope on the horizon, with the news we get daily about vaccines. Multiple companies releasing and getting their vaccines approved; we may yet soon see a path forward.

The CDC in the US releases daily vaccine data and has a vaccination progress tracker on its site CDC Tracker.

NBC News has a vaccine tracker as well which is quite well done. NBC News Vaccine Tracker

Using the robust toolset provided by Kaggle I decided to create my own data tracker

The dataset for vaccine data is drawn from Our World In Data who update their vaccine datasets from the CDC quite regularly, this allows the notebook to have fresh data.

Here is the link to that dataset

THe population dataset is pulled from the 2019 US Census and I've uploaded it here along with latitude and longitude data for each states' capital city.

Feel Free to fork this notebook and improve on my work, I look forward to seeing what you create!
